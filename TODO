-----------------------------------------------

1) Make it a true command-line tool

Remove all interaction, and simplify usage.

Modes of usage:

a) "cfu.sh"
prints out all information and exits.

b) "cfu.sh --help", "cfu.sh -h"

c) "cfu.sh --version", "cfu.sh -v"

d) "cfu.sh x" sets it to governor number x

e) "cfu.sh u x" sets it to governor USERSPACE with number x


2) Use nounset

Variable ffile in function savegovern is used undefined.
Perhaps that function should come in two versions.
One should also specify this function.
The function looks too complicated.


3) Perhaps use errexit

Where is the first non-zero exit code?
